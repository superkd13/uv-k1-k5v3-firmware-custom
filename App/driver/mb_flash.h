 * Multiboot flash programmer.
 *
 * M1 (validated): brick-critical core - reprogram the internal application flash
 * from an image held in the external SPI flash, running from RAM.
 *
 * M2 (this file): slot format + integrity validation. Each slot starts with a
 * header (magic, size, CRC32, name, version); a restore validates the header and
 * the image CRC32 *before* erasing anything, so an incompatible or corrupt image
 * can never brick the radio. There is a single firmware for both the K1 and the
 * K5v3 (the keypad difference is handled at runtime by the hidden SetNav menu),
 * so no per-model guard is needed.
